Purpose: It is commonly believed within the tennis community that you must be tall to play. On the other hand, shorter players have arguably been just as successful as or even more successful than taller players. So this introduces the question, does height matter?

I've decided to answer the following question: Is a player's height a factor in how many tournaments they will win in the future? Players' heights, names, ages, tournaments won, games won, points earned and lost, and aces were  included in this study. The program in this repo was used to manipulate, transform, and extract the necessary data for analysis.
